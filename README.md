# Uni-Work
Examples of university assignments and tutorials, this repo is grouped by course. I have projects from the courses: Intro to Programming (Java basic coding course); Data structures; Intro to Ai; and Graphics and Multimedia\
I am going through each one and improving them with any new knowledge/skills I have gained before I add them to the repo. \
Plus some of them were designed to work with specific submission software so have to be changed to work stand alone. \
Will add them as I go through them. \
\
TODOs:
* Finish Java basics folder
* Add Data Structures
* Add Intro to AI
* Add Graphics and Multimedia
