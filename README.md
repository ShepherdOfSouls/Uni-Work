# Uni-Work
Examples of university assignments and tutorials. The repo is grouped by course.
I am going through each one and improving them with any new knowledge/skills I have gained before I add them to the repo.
Plus some of them were designed to work with specific submission software so have to be changed to work stand alone.
Will add them as I go through them.
