# Quadratic Root Calculator
A small program that takes input from the user to fill in the coefficients for the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. /
Using this it calculates and returns the roots of this equation with a message, using the discriminant and a variable to determine if it: is not a quadratic, has complex roots (no roots on the cartesian plane), has one root or had two roots.
