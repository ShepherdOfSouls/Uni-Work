# Java Basics
These are the tutorials and assignments I did in my basic learning to code course.
I cannot find the specifications for the labs past week 5 or any of the assignments so I will need to look through them and make READMEs to describe their purpose, though they are fairly simple to understand.
TODO:
* READMEs/find specifications
