# Classifier Using K-NN and Naive Bayers
The specifications for this assignment are very specific and the classifier does not really work standalone, I will fix this in the future.
Basically the classifier takes normalised data with a yes or no classification for training, similar to that found in pima.csv, and then can classify new data with similar normalised values.
All the .csv files are the result of data manipulation using WEKA. I cannot seem to find the report that was part of the assignment so I will need to redo the evaluation to some degree and include that later.
TODOs
* Manipulate the .csv files so that they can be used with my classifier, make some code that can use the folded data.
* Do some evaluations and create a small report.
