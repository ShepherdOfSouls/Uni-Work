#Solution Algorithms Assignment
The full specifications are in the pdf but the TL;DR is that the program must turn one 3-digit number, S, into another, G, by applying +/- 1 to a single digit at a time, then print the solution path.
The specification required this to be done with multiple algorithms.
TODOs
*testing suite is a little underwhleming because the university had its own in-browser testing, will vamp up a little.
