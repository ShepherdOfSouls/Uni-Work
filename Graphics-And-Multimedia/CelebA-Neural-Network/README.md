#CelebA Convolutional Neural Network
Using Jupyter Notebooks and Pytorch library. Full specifications in the Assignment-Specification pdf.
A CNN whose purpose is to detect if an image has any features from a list of 40.
The dataset used is CelebA, the location of which can be found in the Specification though Pytorch has a function to automatically download this.
Will need to download the dataset to make the classifier work, to do so can set "download = True" in the celebA_data_trainset, celebA_data_validset, celebA_data_testset. I would not recommend this as it is almost 3gb, which is why I have not included it here.
In the future I will run it on my computer and then include images and results in this repo.
TODOs
*Assignment required a lot of experimentation which lead to very messy code as I just commented out lines when I didn't use them, will clean it up.
