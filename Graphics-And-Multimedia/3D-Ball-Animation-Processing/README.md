#3D Ball Animation
Made using Processing 3.5.4
Full specifications can be found in the assignment specification pdf, but the task was basically to make it so that balls are created on click that have semi-realistic movement and collision, gravity included.
Images are the set of skins that the created balls can have.
TODOs
*Make gravity/air friction more realistic
*Make ball skins move based on collisions
*Make ball collision rebound velocity affected by the other ball, not just the speed of itself
