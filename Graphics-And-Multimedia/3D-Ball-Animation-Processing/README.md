# 3D Ball Animation
Made using Processing 3.5.4 \
The assignment specification was to create a box where, when the mouse is clicked, a sphere is created and moves through the space. \
The spheres must:
* Be instantiated with a random texture and velocity vector.
* Bounce semi-realistically off walls and other spheres, this includes direction a speed changes.
* Balls must constantly be affected by gravity and speed must decay according to time and bounces.
* Work without latency for up to 10 balls at once.
\
TODOs
* Make gravity/air friction more realistic, bit spacey. Possibly use "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion"
* Make ball skins move based on collisions.
* Make ball collision rebound velocity affected by the other ball, not just the speed of itself.
* Maybe pick some better textures.
