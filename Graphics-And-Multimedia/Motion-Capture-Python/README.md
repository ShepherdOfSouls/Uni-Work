#Motion Capture Program
Made using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
Takes a video and calculates the approximate motion vectors between frames and creates a video with the vectors added.
Haven't included results at the moment, just the code (Assignment 1a.IPYNB), specification (Assignment-Specification.pdf) and video to disect (original.avi). 
Github doesn't seem to play nicely with videos, will either see if I can learn to include somehow in the future or do on my own computer and include images of the results.
TODOs
*Include results in repo
*Make lines show directions clearer and look less messy
