#First Year Data Structures Course
I cannot find the specifications for the tutorials or assignments on this course so I will need to go through and add descriptions in the future.
The course focused on data structures like trees, lists and graphs, learning how to create them and then manipulate them effectively, for instance with time efficient search functions.
TODOs
*Add descriptions.
